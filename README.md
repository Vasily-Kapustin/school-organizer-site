# school-organizer-site

This is a project that I worte to help me organize university course work, I wrote this during a very hectic period of my life where I started to notice that my regular study habbits would not cut it. It genuinely helped me get back from being 3 weeks behind on my courses.
The main features of it are:
  The ability to write notes for every lecture for every course independantly
  Keep track of important upcoming dates
  Keep track of incomplete work
