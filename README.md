# school-organizer-site

This is a project that I worte to help me organize university course work, I wrote this during a very hectic period of my life where I started to notice that my regular study habbits would not cut it. It genuinely helped me get back from being 3 weeks behind on my courses.

The main features of it are:

  The ability to write notes for every lecture for every course independantly
  
  Keep track of important upcoming dates
  
  Keep track of incomplete work


This entire project is written on the platform of Node Js, MongoDB for the database and Handlebars for the rendering engine.

# Installation instructions

1. Download project

2. Run npm install command because this downlaod does not come with the npm packages

3. The Default entry point is the bin/www file for setting the port on which the local server runs on. <b>Not App.js </b>

# Somethings to note 
I know this isnt a complete solution, I'm in the process of adding a calendar and other features that would make my life easier.
I know the stylization of the website has some improvment that needs to be done, I'm primarily a backend developer and I believe I still have a lot to learn about UX.
In the long term I would like launch this as a public service for free once this is more refined.
